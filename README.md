# CE888-In-vehicle-coupon-recommendation-classification

This project aims at classification and understanding the steps like preprocessing, pa-
rameter tunning etc and the classification algorithms. In this project, ”in coupon vehicle
recommendation” dataset is considered for classification. The dataset has various numerical
and string features. The aim is to preprocess the dataset and train the classifier to predict
whether the driver will accept the coupon if he is selected as the driver for the ride. Random
forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression classifier is used for prediction here.
Also grid search algorithm is applied to find the best parameters for the model. The models
are then trained using the best parameters obtained.
